# Anthropic-compatible API

The Anthropic-compatible API routes Messages directly to Anthropic, OpenRouter,
DeepSeek, Hugging Face Inference Providers, Bedrock Anthropic models,
Vertex AI models selected as `anthropic/<model>`, and custom OpenAI endpoints
with `messagesPath` configured. OpenCode Zen and Go also use native Messages
when the model catalog resolves to `@ai-sdk/anthropic`; see
[OpenCode routing](../../developer/design/features/opencode.md). These paths preserve
native content blocks, thinking, cache controls, tool definitions, beta headers,
and JSON/SSE responses. Model selectors and Vertex's required request envelope
are adjusted for routing; other semantic validation belongs to the upstream.

Providers without a declared Messages endpoint use the experimental Chat
conversion described below. All paths share provider selection, virtual-model
fallback, credential profiles, key rotation and cooldown, Gateway routing,
and cancellation. The selected capability is checked for each concrete model.
Native responses do not inject optional `llm_proxy` response metadata; Gateway
metadata and logs still apply. See [Native inference](../../developer/design/features/native_inference.md).

The compatibility contract follows the
[Anthropic Messages API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages/create),
last verified on 2026-08-14.

## Messages

`POST /v1/messages` and its `/messages` alias accept an Anthropic Messages body
whose `model` uses the same provider-qualified selector as the
OpenAI-compatible API:

```bash
curl https://your-worker.example/v1/messages \
  --header "x-api-key: $PROXY_API_KEY" \
  --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-5.4",
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the sky blue?"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

### Request conversion fallback

This section applies only when the selected provider lacks a native Messages
capability.

The handler reads at most 10 MiB and validates the JSON object and `model`. The
conversion fallback additionally requires `max_tokens` and `messages`.

User and assistant text map to Chat messages. Anthropic base64 and URL image
sources become Chat image URLs. Assistant `tool_use` blocks become function
tool calls, and user `tool_result` blocks become tool messages. A missing tool
result content becomes an empty message, while `is_error` is removed because
Chat has no equivalent.
Parallel calls within one assistant turn share a single Chat `tool_calls`
array. Text and calls retain their respective order within that assistant
message; tool results remain subsequent tool messages.

The top-level `system` value and `system` role messages, including
`mid_conv_system` text, become system messages. Custom tool definitions,
including the explicit `type: "custom"` form, and `auto`, `any`, `tool`, and
`none` tool choices map to their Chat equivalents. Parallel-tool control, stop
sequences, token limits, sampling values, streaming, and `metadata.user_id` are
also retained. `output_config.effort` maps to `reasoning_effort`, and
`output_config.format` maps to a Chat JSON Schema response format named
`response`. Function-tool `strict` maps to the corresponding Chat option.
Prompt-cache annotations on otherwise supported system, text, image, tool-use,
tool-result, and tool-definition objects are removed.

Each provider filters the converted Chat fields according to its declared
capability.

### Response conversion

A successful object-valued Chat response is parsed up to 5 MiB. Assistant text,
refusals, and function calls become Anthropic `text` and `tool_use` content
blocks. Finish reasons map to `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, `tool_use`, or
`refusal`, and Chat usage becomes the current Anthropic usage shape. Fields
without Chat data are present with `null`, including container, refusal details,
cache creation, inference geography, output-token details, server-tool usage,
and service tier. Text blocks contain `citations: null`. Non-successful upstream
responses retain their status and body.

For `text/event-stream`, the proxy converts Chat chunks incrementally
into `message_start`, `content_block_start`, `content_block_delta`,
`content_block_stop`, `message_delta`, and `message_stop` events. Multiline SSE
data is joined before parsing. Message start and delta events use the current
message, delta, and usage field sets.
Chat refusal deltas are streamed as text in the same text block.

Anthropic content blocks are sequential, while Chat chunks may interleave text
and tool-call deltas. The converter therefore streams text at index 0, retains
tool arguments, then emits each `tool_use` block complete after closing the text
block.

When `CHAT_RESPONSE_METADATA_ENABLED=true`, JSON output retains the Chat route's
top-level `llm_proxy` object. Streaming output places it on the final
`message_delta` event. This additive field is proxy-specific and disabled by
default.

### Streaming limits and failures

The converter independently caps each SSE record at 1 MiB, cumulative text at
4 MiB (including refusals), cumulative tool arguments at 4 MiB, cumulative tool
metadata at 64 KiB, tool calls at 64, and output items
at 64. These limits leave headroom beneath the Workers 128 MiB isolate limit.

Malformed or oversized streams emit a terminal error without `message_stop`
and cancel the upstream stream. Chat chunks containing an upstream error or
`finish_reason: "error"` emit a fixed error message without copying the upstream
error payload or reporting successful completion. A stream is also treated as truncated when it
ends without `[DONE]`. Backpressure and downstream cancellation otherwise
propagate through the Chat path.

### Ignored and unsupported features

Top-level Messages fields without a supported Chat Completions conversion,
including unknown fields, are ignored rather than forwarded. Unsupported
members of otherwise convertible objects and independently removable content
blocks, system blocks, tool-result parts, tool definitions, and tool choices
are also omitted while compatible parts of the same request are converted.
This includes documents, search results, citations, thinking content, server
tools, MCP connectors, containers, context management, future extensions, and
prompt-cache annotations.

HTTP 400 is reserved for a malformed request envelope, missing required fields,
or an invalid shape for a recognized value required to perform a safe
conversion. The converted response reports only the behavior that actually
ran. The compatibility endpoint includes only direct, tested mappings that
preserve semantics and require no proxy state or tool execution.

## Token counting

`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` returns an Anthropic-shaped HTTP 400 error.
Token counting is not approximated because Chat Completions has no equivalent
operation that preserves Anthropic tokenization.
